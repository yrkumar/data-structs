data-structs
============

A collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in C, complete with unit tests and code contracts for correctness, as well as a Makefile for easy compilation.

Included Data Structures/Algorithms
-------------------------------------------
1. Searching Algorithms 
2. Sorting Algorithms *
3. Linked Lists *
4. Doubly Linked Lists *
5. Stacks * 
6. Queues *
7. Unbounded Arrays * 
8. Hash Tables *
9. Binary Search Trees *
10. AVL Trees *
11. Min Heaps *

* = yet to be implemented

Usage
-----

Clone the git repo into your project directory and include the necessary header file(s) in your project
```bash
$ cd yourProject/
$ git clone git@github.com:yrkumar/data-structs.git lib/
$ echo "#include <necessaryStruct.h>" >> projFile.c
```

To-Do Checklist
---------------

- add code contracts to what's done so far
- finish the rest of the data structures/algorithms with code contracts and unit tests
- add header files for all of the library files
