data-structs
============

A collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in C, complete with unit tests and code contracts for correctness, as well as a Makefile for easy compilation.

Included Data Structures/Algorithms
------------------------------------
1. Searching Algorithms 
2. Sorting Algorithms 
3. Linked Lists 
4. Stacks  
5. Queues 
6. Doubly Linked Lists *
7. Unbounded Arrays * 
8. Hash Tables *
9. Binary Search Trees *
10. AVL Trees *
11. Min Heaps *

* = yet to be implemented

Usage
-----

Clone the git repo into your project directory.
```bash
$ cd yourProject/
$ git clone git@github.com:yrkumar/data-structs.git lib/
```
Then, include the necessary header file(s) in your project. Make sure to compile your project with the .c file that corresponds to the data structure/algorithm set that is needed.

To-Do Checklist
---------------

- add dependencies to each file
- finish the rest of the data structures/algorithms with code contracts, header files, and unit tests
- add nice printing UI functionality (i.e. for arrays and such)
